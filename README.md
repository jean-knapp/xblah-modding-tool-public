# XBLAH's Modding Tool

XBLAH's Modding Tool was built to improve Valve games modders' productivity and quality of life.

A fantastic tool for creating and running mods. it's an extremely useful tool for all mappers and modders for Goldsrc and Source that puts an emphasis on making several tasks easier and streamlined so that you spend less time with trial and error and more time finishing the project of your dreams.

Automate the process of creating blank GoldSRC and Source mods. Easily create new chapters, with chapter images and chapter backgrounds, automatically install Hammer++, edit soundscapes, and much more. All of that in a single intuitive tool, with no scripting knowledge required. Create your mod, launch hammer, and that's it.
